# Brief introduction about myself
Hello! My name is Kalkidan Shimeles, and I am an Electrical Engineer with a strong passion for programming and technology. Over the years, my curiosity about how things work—both in circuits and in code—has driven me to explore the world of software development alongside my engineering journey.

I truly enjoy learning new programming languages, building projects, and solving problems through code. My goal is to keep expanding my skills in software development, combining them with my engineering background to create innovative and practical solutions. Beyond just learning, I love the challenge of turning ideas into something functional and real, whether it’s a small script or a bigger project that brings concepts to life.

This journey into coding and version control is an exciting step toward growing as both an engineer and a developer. I’m eager to keep learning, experimenting, and building projects that will shape my skills for the future.
